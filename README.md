## About the Project

"FlowForge" is designed to offer an intuitive interface that simplifies the process of creating and managing LLM workflows as a self-hosted solution. It facilitates prompt testing and comparison, and it incorporates version control features to help users track the development of their prompts. Suitable for both small teams and large enterprises, "FlowForge" seeks to improve productivity and foster the practical use of LLM technology.
